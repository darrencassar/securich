List of features:

1. Secure permitting only root to change the password of a user or the user himself.
2. Password history stores 5 passwords including the timestamp when the last password change occurred and the first time the user was created
3. Password has a minimum complexity requirement and user needs to supply his old password in order to authenticate to replace it with a new one
4. There is a minimum recycle time for a password, that is it can be changed up to 10 times in 1 day but these cycles don't affect the password history. IE a password is only included in the history if the password had been in use for more than 1 day.
5. Global, Database, Table and Procedure level privileges
6. Updatable roles, that is when a role is updated, users using that role can be updated using `call RECONCILIATION('sync');`
7. Clone a new user from one you know is the same (everything is the same apart from the username, host, emailaddress and password).
8. Updating a role propagates to the privileges any user having that role has i.e. it is dynamic.
9. `mysql` database is considered a "sacred" database by securich and therefore the latter (securich) doesn't allow granting of privileges to it by default. A configuration parameter needs to be teaked in sec_config setting mode=lenient instead of the default mode='strict' in order to allow grants on mysql db.
10. Can automatically reconcile from mysql to securich.
11. Password restrictions are fully configurable.
12. Includes a password dictionary to make sure no common passwords are used.
13. Enables installation by other users not just root

Limitations:

1. Doesn't cater for functions
2. Doesn't cater for columns
3. Can't be used to grant the grant option or limitations with the number of queries / connections per period of time.
4. If a stored procedure is deleted / dropped, then the rights attached to it are lost as well so `call reconciliation('sync');` should be executed right after a stored procedure is recreated.
